# Futures-Trading-Strategy-Evaluation-A-Comprehensive-Guide-to-Backtesting-Mean-Reversion-Alphas

This workbook implements a backtesting system for a futures trading strategy. 
Backtesting is the process of testing a trading strategy on historical data to see how it would have performed, before risking real money. This helps determine if the strategy has an edge and is likely to be profitable going forward.

The strategy being tested appears to be a mean reversion strategy on a portfolio of interest rate futures contracts. Mean reversion is based on the idea that prices and returns eventually move back towards their long-term average. When the current price is far from its average, a trade is opened expecting it to revert back to the mean.

The key components and steps in this backtesting system are:

1. Inputting and disaggregating the historical data on futures prices, durations, weights, and rolling statistics (average and standard deviation of prices). This raw data is parsed from an InputData.csv file.

2. Initializing key parameters like the number of equities, point prices, tick sizes, margin requirements, transaction costs, assets under management (AUM), position sizing rules, entry/exit thresholds (z-score and t-score), max number of positions, roll dates etc. These parameters define how the strategy will be implemented.

3. Preprocessing the raw data to compute additional metrics needed for the strategy at each timestamp:
- Time to maturity for each contract 
- Future expected durations given current time to maturity
- Margin utilization
- Notional position sizing based on a fixed initial margin per position
- Expected position sizes in each contract given the portfolio weights
- Overall portfolio price, tick size, z-score and t-score

4. Simulating the trading signals and positions:
- Long positions are opened when the portfolio z-score and t-score are below defined thresholds (e.g. -1.5 and -4.0 respectively), indicating a large negative deviation from mean
- Positions are sized based on a fixed initial margin per trade divided by the current margin utilization
- Positions are closed when either a profit target or stop loss level is hit, defined in terms of number of ticks, or at contract roll date if still open

5. Calculating the P&L, transaction costs, and net P&L for the strategy over time, based on the positions and price changes at each timestamp

6. Conducting a detailed analysis of the strategy's performance:
- Total return, annualized return and volatility, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown
- Trade win rate, avg win/loss, total trades, largest win/loss, profit factor 
- Average and max position sizes, position vs return correlations
- Rolling risk metrics like volatility and Sharpe ratio
- Plotting the equity curve, drawdowns, trade and return distributions, and other visualizations

The main mathematical formulas used are:

- Z-score: (Current Price - Average Price) / Standard Deviation
- T-score: (Current Price - Average Price) / Portfolio Tick Size
   - These normalize the deviation from mean in terms of volatility and minimum price movements
- Margin Utilization: Sum(Weight * Margin) over all positions
- Notional Position Size: Fixed Initial Margin per Trade / Margin Utilization
- P&L: Sum(Previous Day's Position * (Current Price - Previous Price)) 
- Transaction Cost: Commission Rate * Sum(Abs(Current Position - Previous Position) * Tick Size) 
- Rolling Volatility: Standard Deviation(Daily Returns, Lookback Window) * Sqrt(252)
- Sharpe Ratio: Average(Daily Returns - Daily Risk Free Rate) / Standard Deviation(Daily Returns)

The key Python functions and classes include:

- Positions and PortPositions: Store position state and handle position sizing limits
- BacktestingSystem: Stores strategy parameters and functions for data processing and P&L calculations
- TradingSystemVisualizer: Creates charts and graphs to visualize the backtest results
- analyze_trading_system: Calculates a full set of performance metrics on the strategy

In terms of empirical results, the specific performance will depend on the exact parameters used, but in general, backtests are used to determine:
- If the strategy has a positive expected return after accounting for transaction costs
- What the average and tail risks are in terms of volatility and drawdowns 
- How consistent the edge is across different market regimes
- What the ideal position sizing and risk limits should be to maximize risk-adjusted returns
- If there are any biases like weak returns in certain months or markets that need to be accounted for

Some illustrations of typical visualizations include:
- A chart of the cumulative performance and underwater equity curve over time 
- A histogram of individual trade returns
- Heatmaps or tables of performance metrics broken out by different market conditions
- Timeseries plots of rolling volatility, drawdowns, or exposure levels

For those interested in learning more, some relevant literature on backtesting and mean reversion strategies:

- Introduction to Quantitative Finance: A Math Tool Kit by Robert R. Reitano

The key takeaways are that a well-structured backtesting system is critical for evaluating trading strategies based on historical data. It requires carefully gathering and processing the relevant price and fundamental data, precisely specifying the entry/exit rules and position sizing, and accurately calculating P&L while accounting for transaction costs and slippage. The performance then needs to be rigorously analyzed to determine if there is a persistent edge that holds up across different markets and time periods, with visualization of the results. Only then can a strategy be considered for real money trading.
